## React Native Tutorial 2

<hr>

This application focuses on creating a user login form where a user can log in and then logout. The app uses firebase for persisting users.

The flow of the application is the app makes a third party api call to the firebase store to see if the user already has logged in, if not, it displays a login form where the user can sign in

Key things learned from React Native:

- Creating components in a way that makes them reusable through props and props.children
- Understanding that app feedback to the user from any event is extremely important to user experience
- React native components like _Activity Indicator_, _TextInput_, _styling objects in react native_
- How to work with forms in react native, specifically creating controlled inputs and _"onChangeText_" property
